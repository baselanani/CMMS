Note: This project is Incomplete.

This is a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) project. The project is structured with a separated client and server architecture. However, at this stage, the client and server are not fully integrated yet.

Project Structure

  Client (cmms folder): The frontend is built using React.js. Currently, the client is using mock data and does not yet make real API calls to the server. It is primarily focused on the UI and rendering the data, but it doesn't interact with the backend at this stage.
  
  Server (cmms-server folder): The backend is built using Node.js and Express. The server is handling HTTP requests that are sent manually. It does not yet have full integration with the frontend, and the endpoints are being tested independently.
